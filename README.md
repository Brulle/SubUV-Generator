# SubUV Generator
Simple tool that generates a sub-uv texture by a folder of images.

## Instructions
- 1. Drop images
  - 1:1. Get your images.
  - 1:2. Have their name in number order.
  - 1:3. Drop them in to the image folder. (It can be anywhere, just place it in the SubUV Generator folder and change the input folder.)

- 2. Settings
  - 2:1. Open settings.ini.
  - 2:2. Apply the input folder. (Where all the images will be picked up from)
  - 2:3. Apply the output file. (Use it to name the generated image.)
  - 2:4. Apply the image size. (How long each column and row is.)
  - 2:5. Apply the tile size. (How big each tile will be. Affects the image size as well.)
  - 2:6. Save and close settings.ini.

- 3. Start up
  - 3:1. Open the [start.bat](./start.bat).

- 4. Troubleshooting (Incase of error)
  - 4:1. Open log.txt.
  - 4:2. Look for the issue in logs. (You can easily check which is error and not by looking after the date. If correct it should say INFO and if there is and error it should say ERROR. Scroll through the log and check if the is an error and if there is, then check what causes it and go back and fix the issue.)
